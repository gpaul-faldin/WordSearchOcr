# WordSearchOcr

## Overview

WordSearchOcr is a project designed to autonomously solve WordSearch games available at [thewordsearch.com](https://thewordsearch.com/). The solution is achieved through the integration of OpenCV, Tesseract.js, and Robot.js.

## Features

- **Autonomous WordSearch Solver:** Utilizes computer vision (OpenCV) and optical character recognition (Tesseract.js) to identify and extract words from WordSearch puzzles.
- **Mouse Automation:** Implements Robot.js for simulating mouse movements and clicks, enabling the program to interact with the WordSearch interface autonomously.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Configure the settings inside config.json (Only tested on 1080p screen)

## Usage

1. Run the WordSearchOcr script:

```bash
npm start
```
2. Sit back and watch as the program autonomously solves WordSearch puzzles!

## Finished Project

The project is finished on my side, and while the code may not be perfect, I'm satisfied with the results.

To see the program in action, check out this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIiOrXnvHj8). The video showcases the WordSearchOcr script autonomously solving WordSearch puzzles on [thewordsearch.com](https://thewordsearch.com/). Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your needs. Happy solving!
