# WordSearchOcr

## Overview

WordSearchOcr is a project designed to autonomously solve WordSearch games available at [thewordsearch.com](https://thewordsearch.com/). The solution is achieved through the integration of OpenCV, Tesseract.js, and Robot.js.

## Features

- **Autonomous WordSearch Solver:** Utilizes computer vision (OpenCV) and optical character recognition (Tesseract.js) to identify and extract words from WordSearch puzzles.
- **Mouse Automation:** Implements Robot.js for simulating mouse movements and clicks, enabling the program to interact with the WordSearch interface autonomously.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Configure the settings inside config.json (Only tested on 1080p screen)

## Usage

1. Run the WordSearchOcr script:

```bash
npm start
```
2. Sit back and watch as the program autonomously solves WordSearch puzzles!

## Finished Project

The project is finished on my side, the code is not perfect but I'm fine with it :)
